EE3-24 Embedded Systems - Lloyd Abbott, Pierre Azalbert, Jukka Hertzog, Periklis Korkontzelos

## Coursework 1 - IoT project

We have a temperature + humidity sensor that we can use with the Adafruit Huzzah Feather board.
The board contains an ESP8266 chip with MicroPython on it.
Micropython documentation for ESP8266: https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/index.html

### Deliverables
- Demo showing sensing, processing and upload of data
- Code submission via GitHub
- Website* marketing concept for product

### Timetable
- 2nd Feb: Lab on wifi
- 9th Feb: demo of project
- 16th Feb : submit code and website

### Our ideas for an IoT device
- holiday home environment control (prevent mould etc)
- wood drying monitor (for fireplaces)
- pantry monitoring
- laundry drying monitor
- rust n stuff
- wine storage
- sauna monitoring
- body heat (sweat)
- baby incubator
- baby cradle monitor (https://blog.withings.com/2012/03/30/why-is-measuring-the-humidity-level-in-a-room-important-for-a-baby-2/)
- tobacco storage (humidor)
- shoe fungus prevention
- home brewing, fermenting (yoghurt, etc)
- biological petri dish monitor
- fan-hat
